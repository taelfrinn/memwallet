unlock modal popup ?
how to handle unlocking

keep wallet unlocked, and have a timer to forget the passphrase ?
	this would make the damn thing yea much faster
		have a display area for the state:  no wallet/Wallet Loaded [PO]/Wallet Unlocked
make whole border red ?

fingerprint generation

MINOR
	electrum style password suggestifier- mn_encode from brainwallet

	better RNG impl?

	memwallet: send message to any pubkey(hex) select using a radio button
	memwallet: javascript stealthcoins
	memwallet: add stealth nonces to private serialization
	add warning if RNG not seeded - alert?

	receive stealth coin
		add stealth coin
		decode stealth coins - separate batch operation

	timers to do the dwallet generation
		progress bar that locks whole screen
		timer with heartthrobbing mightbe best

MAJOR
	refactor top down, adding only my stuff

	update everything to latest version of cryptojs,
		This may impact other codes, like scrypt and bitcoin key classes
		reorganize this into a compressed/mnified crypto.js section
		with the other 3rd party stuff also minified and shrunkdown

	balance checking tab

	spending transaction making tab
